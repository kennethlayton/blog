## Hey, I'm Kenneth!

I'm passionate about building AI systems, running experiments, and sharing what I learn along the way.

### My Background

- **Software Engineer** - I currently work full-time as a software engineer, so many of my experiments and blog posts come from that perspective. If you're also a software engineer, I'd love to connect!
- **Build AI Systems** — I create personal tools to explore how AI can enhance personal productivity and creativity
- **Run Experiments** — I love testing ideas, whether it's a new ML technique or a creative project
- **Write & Share** — I document my learnings here so others can benefit from the journey

### My Interests

When I'm not tinkering with code and models, you'll find me:

- Reading about machine learning and AI advancements
- Working on creative side projects
- Hanging out with my beautiful family

### Get in Touch
